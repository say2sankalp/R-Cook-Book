#The p-value is small and so itâ€™s unlikely (based on the sample data) that 95 could be
#the mean of the population.
#Informally, we could interpret the low p-value as follows. If the population mean were
#really 95, then the probability of observing our test statistic (t = 3.2832 or something
 #                                                                more extreme) would be only 0.001897. That is very improbable, yet that is the value
#we observed. Hence we conclude that the null hypothesis is wrong; therefore, the sample
#data does not support the claim that the population mean is 95.
